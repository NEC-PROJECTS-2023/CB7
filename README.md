### Introduction
YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for sharing videos and has become an important tool for content creators and marketers. The Trending section on YouTube highlights the most popular videos on the platform, making it a highly sought-after spot for creators to showcase their content. Understanding the factors that contribute to a video's virality can provide insights into YouTube's audience and content trends, and help creators and marketers optimize their content for maximum visibility and reach.In recent years, analysts have increasingly turned to machine learning techniques to analyse large datasets of metadata, enabling insights into user behaviour and content trends on online platforms. Our study leverages these techniques, applying the Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor to analyse metadata of over 40,000 videos in YouTube's Trending section. Our objective is to identify the factors that influence a video's Virality on YouTube and provide actionable recommendations to creators and marketers for optimizing their content on the platform. By doing so, we hope to provide insights into the value of using machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets of metadata and their potential to inform content strategies and marketing efforts on online platforms like YouTube.
